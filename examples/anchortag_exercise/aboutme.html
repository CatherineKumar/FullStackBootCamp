<h3>Greetings! I am a Software Engineer with experience in application and database development.</h3>
<p>I started working in technology in the late 1990's and have extensive experience supporting complex applications and databases. As a developer, I have worked with different programing languages and supported front-end code, server-side code, and databases. I became a database administrator somewhat by accident. Often times, I found myself doing production support for applications where there was no available database administrator. Being the type of person that likes to jump in and fix things, I learned databases adminstration out of necessity. Currently, I work as a consultant in Dallas, Texas</p>
<p>I am looking to expand my skills in web and mobile development. While I have many years of experience with SQL databases, I would like to gain knowledge of NoSQL database and different cloud technologies.</p>
<br>
<h3> I love to travel and learn about different cultures. </h3>
<p>When not at work, I love going on vacatons with my family. I am also planning the travel itinerary for my future retirement.</p>
