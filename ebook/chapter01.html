    <h2> Financial Challenges </h2>
        <P>According to surveys conducted in North America many individuals are facing financial challenges</P>
        <p> Today, there are 71 million Baby Boomers, people born between 1946 to 1964. Every day, 10,000 of them turn 65. Many of them are hit hard by financial crisis.</p>
        <p>Generation X, born between 1965 to 1980, are middle-aged adults. They are worried about keeping their jobs and paying bills. Many are caught between the burden of taking care of their own family and helping their aging parents</p>
        <p> At over 72 million adults, Millennials have surpassed the Baby Boomers as America's largest generation. They are facing even bigger hurdles with the new economy.</p>
    <h2> Self Security </h2>    
        <p> The traditional pillars of retirement are now in doubt.</p>
        <h4> Personal Savings</h4>
        <p> More than half of adult Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.

        <h4> Company Pensions </h4>

        <h4> Government Programs </h4>
        <p> Several American government programs provide security in retirement.</p>
            <h5> Social Security</h5>

        <h2> Financial Foundation</h2>
        <p> Like building a house, you should start with a solid financial foundation and build it form the ground up.</p>
            <h3>Debt Management</h3>
                <p>Debt management is a crucial aspect of maintaining one's financial well-being. It involves effectively handling and reducing debts, such as credit card balances, loans, and mortgages. </p>
             <h3>Emergency Fund</h3>
                <p>Having an emergency fund is a financial safety net that everyone should prioritize. It's a dedicated pool of savings set aside for unexpected expenses, like medical bills, car repairs, or sudden job loss. </p>
            <h3>Investment</h3>
                <p>Save and invest for the long run. By putting your money to work in various investment vehicles, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or retirement accounts, you have the potential to grow your wealth over time.</p>
            <h3>Protection</h3>
                <p>Protect in the form of insurance should be a priority in building a solid financial foundation. In case of disability, major illness, or sudden death, savings may not last very long. </p>
