// 1. Define 2 functions
// 1st function named as checkEven which will check if the num passed is even or not.
// 2nd function named as filterEvens which will take an array of numbers and the checkEven function as arguments.
// This filterEvens function will filter out  only even numbers using the checkEven function and generate a new array of the even numbers.
